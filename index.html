    <h2>My Favorite Songs by Hilary Weeks</h2>

    	<ul>
        	<li><a href="https://youtu.be/xyX-I-um5Kk"target="_blank"><strong>Beautiful Heartbreak</strong></a> This song and video has a special place in my heart as I have a connection to the woman in the video who was burned and scarred by a tragic plane accident. Her name is Stephanie Nielson. I was a friend and neighbor to her brother's family at the time of the accident and witnessed miracles through watching them and hearing her story. She is a true example of what it means to go through a "Beautiful Heartbreak."</li>
